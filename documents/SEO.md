## What I learned in Lesson 10

SEO is the mechanism by which search engines rank websites. SEO will look at data on H tags and will prioritie those with smaller numbers (H1 > H6). It is important to keep in mind that SEO algorithms often change and one's approach may need to be adjusted to ensure best results. The goal is that we get the best results organically (in other words free vs paid ads).

Another thing I learned was that links can be helpful. You have to link to a website and they back to you. If you are linking to a website with good SEO ranking that improves your ranking; a website with poor ranking will draw your ranking down.

## Plan for SEO implementation
